We're curious to see if there is a relationship between *longest* leaf length to *total* shoot biomass. 
Data available: In 2017 21 sites were surveyed for seagrass. At each site, 8 0.25m^2 quadrats were surveyed and 5 entire shoots (i.e. multiple leaves) were removed and brought back to the lab to be measured. Each shoot (n = 840) was weighed to get total fresh and dry biomass and each leaf on the shoot had its length and width measured. 

We are interested in the length of the longest leaf and the dry biomass.

And the QQ plot looks real gross with some concavity (i.e. skewness) and some possible outliers. The cooks plot makes it look like there case numbers (171, 230, 498) could be influencial outliers. Some of this is consisten with the histogram of the data (see above)
